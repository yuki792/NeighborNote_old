Welcome to NixNote

This is an open source clone of Evernote designed to run on Linux.  It is written in Java so it will also run on Windows & OS-X, but the primary focus has been to try and get a usable environment for Linux.  While this is designed to work with Evernote, it is in no way connectedwith or supported by Evernote.  Any problems you encounter will not be corrected by them and,since this is GPL software, you are using this software at your own risk.

People have used this with both 64 & 32 bit versions of Linux as well as OpenJDK & Sun's Java and(so far) have not encountered any problems with these different environments.You can download NeverNote from http://www.nevernote.org.  

All the installation information as well as known problemsand currently supported features are located at www.nevernote.org.

Please see license.txt for licensing information.
