NixNote:: Evernote client clone for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows

This is an incomplete clone of Evernote designed to run on Linux. 
It is written in Java so it will also run on other platforms as well but the primary focus has been to try 
and get a usable environment for Linux.  While this is designed to work with Evernote, it is in no way
connected with or supported by Evernote.  Any problems you encounter will not be corrected by them
and, since this is GPL software, you are using this software at your own risk.  

See release.txt for details of what works and what doesn't work.

People have used this with both 64 & 32 bit versions of Linux as well as OpenJDK & Sun's Java 
and (so far) have not encountered any problems with these different environments.
