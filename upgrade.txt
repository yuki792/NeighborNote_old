Upgrading from 0.90 to 0.91

No database upgrade actions are necessary.

-----------------------------------------------------------

If you are upgrading from 0.89 you MUST follow these steps or you could lose data.

You need to do one of these actions:



--- Option #1 ---
1.) Synchronize all notes with Evernote under the old release.
2.) Install the new program & start NeverNote.  This will create a new database.  The next time you synchronize you'll download everything again.  Please note, any non-synchronized notebooks will be lost.


--- Option #2 ---
1.) Synchronize all notes with Evernote under the old release.
2.) Under the old release, do a File/Database Backup and save the backup to a separate location.
3.) Install & start the new release.
4.) Do a File/Database Restore and point to the export file you created in step #2.


--- Option #3 ---
1.) Synchronize all notes with Evernote under the old release.
2.) Copy all the files in your existing NeverNote db directory to another directory.
3.) Copy the file ~/.config/fbn.cx/NeverNote.conf to another directory.
4.) Create the directory ~/.nevernote
5.) Copy the db directory in your NeverNote directory to ~/.nevernote.  For example, if your db directory is in /home/randy/NeverNote/db, you should move it to /home/randy/.nevernote/db.
6.) Install the new program & start NeverNote.
