Translations can be done using linguist or using Launchpad at
https://translations.launchpad.net/nevernote/trunk (maybe)

The script in this directory allows to convert between the XML files
and the standard gettext .po files.

Synchronisation may be like following:
  - Update whole source from source code management system
  - Download po-files from Launchpad and extract them in translations directory
  - Come to this directory and call conversion by: ./i18n.pl *.po
  - Check-in .ts files into source code management system 
  - Upload changed .po and .pot files to launchpad for further translation by volunteers

Conflict solving:
  - When no translations have been changed in a source tree, then "all p(o)" may be chosen
  - When local changes have been done, conflicts should be solved one-by-one
  - "all up(s)tream" should only be choosen when you synchonised data directly
     before you started to make local translations.
